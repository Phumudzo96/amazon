Write code to read the content of the text ﬁle input.txt.

For each line in input.txt, write a new line in the new text ﬁle output.txt
that computes the answer to some operation on a list of numbers.

If the input.txt has the following:

     o Min: 1,2,3,5,6

     o Max: 1,2,3,5,6

     o Avg: 1,2,3,5,6

Your program should generate output.txt as follows:

     o The min of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 1.

     o The max of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 6.

     o The avg of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 3.4.
